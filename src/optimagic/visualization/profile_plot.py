    """Compare optimizers over a problem set.

    This plot answers the question: What percentage of problems can each algorithm
    solve within a certain runtime budget?

    The runtime budget is plotted on the x axis and the share of problems each
    algorithm solved on the y axis.

    Thus, algorithms that are very specialized and perform well on some share of
    problems but are not able to solve more problems with a larger computational budget
    will have steep increases and then flat lines. Algorithms that are robust but slow,
    will have low shares in the beginning but reach very high.

    Note that failing to converge according to the given stopping_criterion and
    precisions is scored as needing an infinite computational budget.

    For details, see the description of performance and data profiles by
    Moré and Wild (2009).

    Args:
        problems: A dictionary where keys are the problem names. Values contain
            information on the problem, including the solution value.
        results: A dictionary where keys are tuples of the form (problem, algorithm),
            values are dictionaries of the collected information on the benchmark
            run, including 'criterion_history' and 'time_history'.
        runtime_measure: This is the runtime until the desired convergence was reached
            by an algorithm. This is called performance measure by Moré and Wild (2009).
        normalize_runtime: If True the runtime each algorithm needed for each problem is
            scaled by the time the fastest algorithm needed. If True, the resulting plot
            is what Moré and Wild (2009) called data profiles.
        stopping_criterion: Determines how convergence is determined from the two
            precisions.
        x_precision: How close an algorithm must have gotten to the true parameter
            values (as percent of the Euclidean distance between start and solution
            parameters) before the criterion for clipping and convergence is fulfilled.
        y_precision: How close an algorithm must have gotten to the true criterion
            values (as percent of the distance between start and solution criterion
            value) before the criterion for clipping and convergence is fulfilled.
        backend: The backend to use for plotting. Default is "plotly".
        template: The template for the figure. If not specified, the default template of
            the backend is used.
        palette: The coloring palette for traces. Default is the D3 qualitative palette.

    Returns:
        The figure object containing the profile plot.
